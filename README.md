Outcome/Learning
During the implementation of this project, I learned a lot. For starters, this is a medium to large-scale commercial project, therefore there was a lot of preparation that I had to complete. Then I learned how redux works wonderfully in large apps with several reducers; in this app, the amazing redux toolkit handles login, cart functionality, order and payment management, and utilising redux makes state management and accessibility inside the components easy. A plus benefit was that I learned how to construct the login feature using JWT tokens and bcrypt packages. On the backend, I learned how to design schema development in mongoDB for these types of commercial projects with many to many relationships, such as a user having multiple orders, and also how to effectively manage all of this many to many data while building this project.
